You may allow third party consultants or contractors to access and use the Software on Your behalf solely for Your internal business operations, provided, they are bound by an agreement with You protecting VMware’s intellectual property with terms no less stringent than this EULA and You ensure that such third party use of the Software complies with the terms of this EULA.  You may make one backup, unmodified copy of the Software solely for archival purpose.  If You upgrade or exchange the Software from a previous validly licensed version, You must cease use of the prior version of that Software.  You agree to provide written certification of destruction of the previous version of the Software upon VMware’s request.

==================

VMware has released a VMware View Client .deb files for i386 but not amd64.  The aim of this project is to provide amd64 ready .deb files for Debian and Ubuntu.

The complete .deb files can be found in each version's directory.  Make sure to download the correct version for your architecture as I have included the original i386 source files used.

The latest amd64 build (1.5.0) can be found at:
https://github.com/mbentley/vmware-view-client/downloads

The latest version of the officially released vmware-view-client for i386 can be found at:
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vmware-view-client/

Using the version built for 10.04 will allow backwards compatibility with Debian Squeeze (6.0)

If you need a program like Adobe Air which does not have 64-bit .deb-package available for your Debian-based system here is way to fix package and get it to work in 64bit systems.

1. Download .deb package of program you want to install

2. In terminal window create temp-directory: mkdir temp

3. Extract the deb file to the temp dir: dpkg-deb -x PACKAGE_NAME-i386.deb temp

4. Extract the control files: dpkg-deb --control PACKAGE_NAME-i386.deb temp/DEBIAN

5. Change the Architecture parameter from "i386" to "all": sed -i "s/i386/all/" temp/DEBIAN/control

6. Repackage the deb file: dpkg -b temp PACKAGE_NAME_64.deb

7. Now you can install it: sudo dpkg -i PACKAGE_NAME_64.deb

Thatâ€™s it! Working like a charm in my Ubuntu 10.10 64bit system.




for vmware-view-client, rename temp/usr/lib to temp/usr/lib32


edit control file
	temp/DEBIAN/control


updating the md5s
	cd temp
	md5deep -lr usr > DEBIAN/md5sums
